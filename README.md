# NetworkScanner
you have to first install scapy in order to use it
Installation of scapy package : 
Use pip:

$ pip install scapy

You can also download the latest version to a temporary directory and install it in the standard distutils way:

$ cd /tmp

$ wget --trust-server-names https://github.com/secdev/scapy/archive/master.zip   # or wget -O master.zip https://github.com/secdev/scapy/archive/master.zip

$ unzip master

$ cd scapy-master

$ sudo python setup.py install

OR 

Refer https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installing-scapy-v2-x 

Now after this copy the scapy package from scapy-master to NetworkScanner

$cp scapy ../scapy
